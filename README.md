Small set of Python tools to analyse textcorpora output from DWDS (dwds.de). A German database of newspaper articles of several decades amongst others.

This is a loose set of scripts created in the course of a homework of a friend. If you are interested in using this and in need of assistant i am gladly to help you. A folder with example Results is attached.
